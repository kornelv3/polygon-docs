## Download the validium repo

1. Create a new directory and cd into it.

    ```bash
    cd ~/
    mkdir cdk-validium
    cd cdk-validium/
    ```

2. Download the `0.0.2` release from the [cdk-validium-contracts github repo](https://github.com/0xPolygon/cdk-validium-contracts/releases/tag/v0.0.2-RC1).

    ```bash
    curl -L -o cdk-validium-contracts.tar.gz https://github.com/0xPolygon/cdk-validium-contracts/archive/refs/tags/v0.0.2.tar.gz
    ```
    !!! note
        The download is available in both `.tar.gz` and `.zip` formats.

3. Extract the files and cd into the repo.

    ```bash
    tar -xzf cdk-validium-contracts.tar.gz
    cd cdk-validium-contracts-0.0.2/
    ```

## Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Create the contracts `.env` configuration

1. Generate a mnemonic, address, and private key using `cast`.

    ```bash
    cast wallet new-mnemonic --words 12
    ```

    !!! tip
        If the command `new-mnemonic` is not found, update foundry with `foundryup` and try again.

    The output should look something like this:

    ```bash
    Phrase:
    island debris exhaust typical clap debate exhaust little verify mean sausage entire
    Accounts:
    - Account 0:
    Address:     0x8Ea797e7f349dA91078B1d833C534D2c392BB7FE
    Private key: 0x3b01870a8449ada951f59c0275670bea1fc145954ee7cb1d46f7d21533600726
    ```

2. Copy the contract environment configuration example file into a new `.env` file.

    !!! important
        You should still be in the `cdk-validium-contracts-0.0.2/` directory from the previous step.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3. Open the `.env` file.

    ```sh
    nano .env
    ```

4. This is what the `.env` file looks like.

    ```txt 
    MNEMONIC="test test test test test test test test test test test junk"
    INFURA_PROJECT_ID=""
    ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=""
    ```

    Replace the variables as follows:

    - `GENERATED_MNEMONIC` is the generated mnemonic phrase from the cast step above.
    - `YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY` is a project id you have already created on Infura Sepolia.
    - `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` is an API key you have already generated on Etherscan. This variable is optional.    

    !!! info
        Check the documentation if you want to [use a different node provider](deploy-contracts.md#use-a-different-node-provider).

## Create the shared system `.env` configuration

1.  Now create a new directory to store the *other* `.env` file, `cd` into it, and create the `.env` file.

    ```sh
    mkdir /tmp/cdk/
    cd ~/tmp/cdk/
    nano .env
    ```

2.  Copy and paste the data below into the file. 

    ```txt
    TEST_ADDRESS=""
    TEST_PRIVATE_KEY="" 
    L1_URL="https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/<YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY>" 
    L1_WS_URL="wss://sepolia.infura.io/ws/v3/<YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY>" 
    ```

    Replace the variables with the following:

    - `TEST_ADDRESS` is the address generated by cast 
    - `TEST_PRIVATE_KEY` is the private key generated by cast
    - `L1_URL` is your Infura Sepolia RPC URL
    - `L1_WS_URL` is your Infura Sepolia wss URL

## Send Sepolia

Send 2 Sepolia ETH to the cast generated address called `TEST_ADDRESS` in the shared `.env` file above.
