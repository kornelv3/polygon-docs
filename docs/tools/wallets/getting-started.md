This page serves as a wallet index for wallets compatible with Polygon. You can browse through the many [partner wallets](#partner-wallets) that support Polygon chains, or choose to go with [Polygon Portal](#native-wallets), which is Polygon's native asset management solution.

Wallets that support Polygon allow for key management, access to accounts controlled by
private keys, and interfaces that allow users to perform chain actions and sign transactions.

!!! info "Non-native wallet support"

      Wallets denoted with * in the table above are not natively supported with the wallet software and require manual steps to add the Polygon network.

## Key management strategy

The following basic steps allow for the integration of a client-side application with Polygon:

1. **Set up Web3**: [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) is a javascript library that
   allows a client-side application to talk to the blockchain. We configure web3.js to communicate
   via a developer-based wallet like MetaMask. Use the [web3.js docs](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.2/getting-started.html#adding-web3-js) to learn about adding `web3.js` to your project.
2. **Set up an account**: You will be able to send transactions (specifically those that alter the
   state of the blockchain).
3. **Instantiate contracts**: Once a web3 object is in place, we next instantiate our deployed contract,
   with which we interact.
4. **Call functions**: Fetch data via functions in the contract through our contract object.
